          <div class="text">The Uyghur Muslims lived in Xinjiang, China, and were put into concentration camps because the government saw their native customs, languages, and traditions as a threat. Previously they were living in overcrowded, closed spaces, and poor medical facilities. Now, however, they are facing oppression from the government and are being put into internment camps where they are beaten and abused. Unfortunately, many in China do not know of the Uyghur’s treatment as the government’s censorship hasn’t allowed word of the situation to get out. </div>

        <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
        <p>Over the years, social media has catalyzed many social justices issues gaining attention. Some of these being Black Lives Matter and the Yemen Crisis. However, when protests are created for these issues, there is a sadly lack of organization. We believe that organization is critical in moments like these and as such, we have planned and created a protest registry and database to make them more effective and facilitate greater change.</p>
